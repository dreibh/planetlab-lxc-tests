Description: VNET test to ensure that terminal packets of TCP connections are properly mapped into slices
Action: Generate a ton of TCP connections and check if tcpdump intercepts the syn/ack packets
Pass: tcpdump intercepts all of the syn/ack packets generated
Fail: tcpdump misses some syn/ack packets as a result of which it does not terminate and an alarm handler is triggered
